## Meeting #1

### About bibliography report

- Introduction of the article has to be more "noob friendly", and be visual. Add schematics.

### Theta waves

Theta waves shows synchronisation process between neurons. 
It's a very controversial subject. Some thinks theta waves encode data, but in animals it seems not to be the case.
Some observed things about theta wave phase, but it's only a correlation, not a causality relation.
We should consider them as something to observe, rather than trying to account for them.

### Interference and CAN models

- Interference : Takes temporal data and wants to show interferences thus observing grid cells : not plausible in 2d.
- CAN : To elaborate, but it is _tendu_ atm.
- G. model : Folding of the data. The PR of L.A. is complete about that.

### Things to work on

- Validate 2d modeling of the G. model, following L.A works.
- Why we are at 60Â° ? See [this](https://elifesciences.org/articles/05913) and [this](https://elifesciences.org/articles/08362)
- Auto-organization problem
- EC as a coding compressor structure. See WIP.
- Understand C code about EC
- Go to lab to work on the simulator

#### Perspectives

- Model as a protocol for neurobiologists
