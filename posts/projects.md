# Projects

Some little projects or ideas i may work on sometime.

## ublog

Simple blog handler made with js, to use with Github Pages.

Articles are written in Markdown, and stay on a Git repository.
The JS lists all the available articles, and converts the Markdown into HTML using [showdownjs](http://showdownjs.com/).

Currently the code is really ugly, but it suits my needs. I may continue coding this thing, and clean it up if i need to.

## nnsynth

nnsynth is a project with no real goal other than making sounds by using neural networks.
The purpose is to use networks that produce oscillating patterns, to play these outputs, or to modulate other networks or neurons with them.

Currently the project is more or less only an idea.
This post will be updated when progress is made.

## cryptocurrency 

I'd like to know how it works, and the best way to understand something is to implement it.
Maybe incorporate some ML, for the _meme_..
