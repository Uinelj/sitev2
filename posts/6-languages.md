# Languages i'd like to try


## Elixir

Elixir seems to be a nice language to work on, when dealing with things that have to be autonomus and distributed.

## Lua

## Rust
 I've tried Rust for some projets, but this language is complex. It has so many (handy) features, and I feel I can't be productive yet using it.
 The concept of ownership is really interesting, though.

## Go
 Goroutines seems to be the easy way of doing multithreaded programs.
 However, the project architecture seems a bit cumbersome.

## Haskell
 Mainly in order to learn what's "true" functionnal programming.
